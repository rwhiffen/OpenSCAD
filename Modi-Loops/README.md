My attempt at OpenScad Modi loops

Modi Loops are a 3d printable system for holding Minis down

The loops: https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-modi-loop-open-source-mini-holder-system-501000

loop-test.scad is me learning how to make cylinders and stuff.  I've never written OpenSCAD before.

The next thing will be to get the text writen on the outside

The next file should be how I learn to parameterize things

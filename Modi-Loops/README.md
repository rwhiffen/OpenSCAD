My attempt at OpenScad Modi loops

Modi Loops are a 3d printable system for holding Minis down

The loops: https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-modi-loop-open-source-mini-holder-system-501000

Some of the code requires you to have the https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2 BOLS2 OpenSCAD library installed. 

loop-test.scad is me learning how to make cylinders and stuff.  I've never written OpenSCAD before.

The next thing will be to get the text writen on the outside

The next file should be how I learn to parameterize things

8/22/2025 - Slow progress - the loop-embossed.scad works as expected - draws the loops and embosses them like I want. The edgest are very hard/square so I'm now I'm playing with the BOLS2 library to see if I can round the edges.  Then I'll start test prints and see what happens.
